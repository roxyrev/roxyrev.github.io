This is a recipe app that allows the user to save and update recipes online. The technologies used in this project are mainly JavaScript, with code also written in HTML. The reason my code is written in both JavaScript and HTML is because I find HTML significantly easier for project creation with visuals (such as this), so I started in HTML (as a sort of outline) and then transferred my code to JavaScript once I had a better idea of what I was doing. I also watched a YouTube video on UX and decided to use CSS as my platform for the appearance of my project, as it seemed to work best for me (I was having difficulty using HTML). Overall, my experience working on this project was pretty good. I ran into a couple issues with the recipe edit function, and getting the UX to be somewhat aesthetic, but overall it was a good project and very manageable with the given time frame.
