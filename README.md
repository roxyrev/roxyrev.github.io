This is a recipe app that allows the user to save and update recipes online. I chose to do my project on this topic because recipes and cooking are very important to me. There was a time in my life where I was primarily taking care of my younger brothers, and one way I was able to connect with them was through food. My love of cooking has carried throughout my entire life, and as more and more resources turn electronic, I wanted to be able to take my recipes with me online. Thus, the idea for this project was born.

The technologies used in this project are mainly JavaScript, with code also written in HTML. The reason my code is written in both JavaScript and HTML is because I find HTML significantly easier for project creation with visuals (such as this), so I started in HTML (as a sort of outline) and then transferred my code to JavaScript once I had a better idea of what I was doing. I also watched a YouTube video on UX and decided to use CSS as my platform for the appearance of my project, as it seemed to work best for me (I was having difficulty using HTML). Overall, my experience working on this project was pretty good. I ran into a couple issues with the recipe edit function, and getting the UX to be somewhat aesthetic, but overall it was a good project and very manageable with the given time frame.
